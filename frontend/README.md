# Electricity connection request management software

- Installation

```bash
# install pnpm in case you haven't already
npm install -g pnpm@latest
# install the dependencies
pnpm i
# start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

And that's all you need to do!, go ahead and access http://localhost:3000/home,

Make sure you have started the backend service as well before running the frontend dev server.
